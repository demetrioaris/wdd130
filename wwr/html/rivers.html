                    <h3>Salmon River</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River
                        of No Return by the people living near it because of the
                        number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love
                        with the rugged beauty of the river that they never
                        left.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV.
                        The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the
                        United States. As a free flowing river the water is
                        higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and
                        lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are
                        good rapids all summer...but families with children who
                        like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's
                        slower, warmer water more.

                    <p>
                        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the
                        most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards
                        the mighty Colorado river and the sea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great
                        rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs
                        from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green
                        River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting
                        geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic
                        human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

                    This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy
                    of all river trips. You will never forget your visit to 
                    the Grand Canyon.

                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater
                    with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable
                    river experience. The canyon is filled not only with
                    exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons
                    and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
