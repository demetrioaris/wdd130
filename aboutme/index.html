      Whay I love to do? I love to listen to music everything I do there is
      always music behind me, and I like to watch tv series.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was studying another career in biomedical, but I decided to change it, I
      change my career to programming because I took a class about intro to
      programming and I think a found the clip about what actually I want to do,
      I never work in this area my previous background is about managing and
      documenting, I work for almost 3 years in a bank now just I am studying.

      So it will be a good time working with you, and I hope we can have great
      time learning this semester.
